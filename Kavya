So to start off with the question you asked me yesterday ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs she different from old ones‚Äù, I was a free soul flirting with random ppl, until this happened I was like that and then I stopped talking to random ppl, I used to think that love is just a physical attraction what ppl think and its basically a business transaction, I was wrong ig.. 

‚Äúlove‚Äù is something which is unconditional, ppl end up doing stupid things in love, spend a whole night chugging stings to write a code that‚Äôll help ur loved one, fasting nd going to temple (as a non-believer at first) just cuz uk that ur loved one isn‚Äôt well and many other such stuff

So basically there is no reason to love someone, used to think it was physical attraction but nah turns out to be wrong ü§™. Its purely unconditional maybe its based on the person‚Äôs behaviour, way of thinking, approach on diff things and other such stuff which were previously ‚Äúinsignificant‚Äù to me.

So yea that‚Äôs how it is, atleast imo, again I‚Äôm no one just writing my thoughts here‚Ä¶

Used to have a complete diff view, used to think ‚Äúlove‚Äù is fictional and flirt around until I actually fell.. and when I fell maybe all my sins paid off by making things completely unfavorable. (sins = past flirting history) and yea I‚Äôm guilty for my sins.

After knowing that shes into someone else, felt as if the world turned around took a decent time to put myself together. There was a point when I felt that I am the reason for everything wrong happening and all the disturbances, felt as if im ruining her friendships and all, so I thought its good if I back off, I told to wipe out completely and be as if we never met each other and continue as strangers forever, I thought saying this would fix up things, but then she told ki she sees me like a frnd, I was like okay‚Ä¶ later on one day I felt this isn‚Äôt right.. this is not how its supposed to be.. with all these feelings and defining it as frndship seemed wrong to me, seemed like acting, so that day I decided to back off. There were many thoughts‚Ä¶ 

I just want her to be happy ryt, so if she‚Äôs happy with someone else so whats my job here?

Why is this happening to me? Why am I so struck with this?

Why not me?

All my sins paying off?

All the time venk was trying to protect me, I‚Äôm a fool

The ‚ÄúWhat ifs‚Äù

This was literally the worst phase ig,

What if things were different

What if things just flip around magically

What if I had met her earlier

What if I was a few inches tall

What if I had a tried and secured a PPO

What if.. What if.. What if.. Screw it there were many!

Does that guy look more attractive? Why him? What am I lacking? Etc etc etc (many more)

Then I understood the one thing, the most imp ‚Äúqualification‚Äù the guy has got.. and that‚Äôs, ‚Äúshe loves him‚Äù and that‚Äôs the ultimatum ryt, nothing else matters after that.

Imo, if u truly love someone u will let them go for their happiness (which I felt was foolish b4 all this), 

‚ÄúNachina valla tho kastam kuda anandam ga ne untadi‚Äù Now, Ik the pain of not getting along with the person whom I actually loved, and I don‚Äôt want her to go through that. I want her to be happy always and forever, no matter how far apart everyone branches out, no matter how many miles away, I just hope her to be happy with whomever she ‚Äúloves‚Äù And that‚Äôs what it is the true definition of love, its pure, not selfish, 

Everyone can love, but being loved by someone whom you love is what matters

Infact even now I pray ‚ÄúGod just make sure she‚Äôs always happy and comfortable‚Äù but I don‚Äôt pray ‚ÄúGod do something that‚Äôll end us together‚Äù

My duality

A part of me is like ‚Äúgo get her!‚Äù another part of me be like ‚Äúits not right what ur doing‚Äù and yes I‚Äôm struck between these!

And yes, I feel ki she‚Äôs uncomfortable cuz of me.. uk with me around, cuz I‚Äôm frnds with u all, in the same class and all‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs one of the reasons I insisted in taking other block.. I think ki she isn‚Äôt the same as she used to be with u all, cuz of what I did, I feel she isn‚Äôt comfortable‚Ä¶ even for the OE-PE thing I didn‚Äôt wanna ask her for the same reason.. cuz I thought she would feel uncomfortable.. but she brought up that topic.. a part of me was like put other options.. but uk how is ryt.. my ‚Äúduality‚Äù ended up putting the same prefs 

Uk the cycle na.. talk->happy->hopes rise->reality kicks in->sad, so to break the cycle I decided not to talk

So yes, I gradually talked less and at one point stopped talking entirely, yup its super hard.. from talking a lot to absolute zero interaction.. but its for the greater good of everyone, 

welcome duality, ta da its here again.. 

R1: Hey why do u wanna be the one taking everything on ur head? Just talk na u will be happy

R2: Think of long span dude, what ur doing is for the greater good..

R1: Screw R2, hes a fool

R2: Shut the F up R1!!

And yes I‚Äôm sadly a human now and can feel the feelings like humans do.. so i breakdown too..why are things like this.. why is this happening to me.. My sins paying off?.. why don‚Äôt I get to be the one who she loves? Etc etc 

Srsly its been ages since I had a happy slp‚Ä¶ its usually bad dreams, panic attacks etc etc and what not.

This is just a peek into my mind.. and when all these increase.. I feel heavy.. I either need to vent stuff out but I cant tell it to anyone na.. this alch, gym and all are just distractions for me, for my mind to uk ‚Äúnot think‚Äù of all these stuff.. gym makes me strained physically and I can have a good night slp.. alch makes me numb and I blabber out and vent leaving me less heavy

Uk, when I joined gym these stuff I didn‚Äôt think of anymore.. so I felt happy actually after a long time and I thought I became myself and I didn‚Äôt care abt ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù anymore I thought I became the rock I was , but one day I don‚Äôt exactly remember ppl told me that shes insecure if her frnd wouldn‚Äôt come and told ki ppl are always behind her back, I felt kinda sad like wherever she goes she doesn‚Äôt feel secure damn what kinda ppl are these.. I heard abt what happened during revels, OG dude u earned my respect, srlsy I take a bow to what u have done. Ppl like those apurv must be punished, uk I think she would have felt more secure if u were on campus. All this made me sad.. knowing how insecure she feels.., I even cried lol, I was like ‚Äúfeelings leni appud y am I feeling sad for her ani‚Äù Appud artam ayindi.. if u truly love someone no matter what u do u will keep on loving no matter what ani, whatever u do its all either distracting urself or lying to urself ani

But then again I thought how am I diff from those ppl like apurv.. I felt guilty, but then I thought.. I‚Äôm distancing myself so that she wouldn‚Äôt feel uncomfortable, but these ppl aren‚Äôt , the difference might seem a insignificant, but its entirely diff ig‚Ä¶

So ig that‚Äôs it ig.. its just a sneak peek into my mind.. theres a lot more to it! its thinking a lot always, to conclude this.. I love/loved/keep loving her no matter what and that I just understood recently and I its not a crime, im not forcing or not demanding from the other party, I‚Äôll carry these feelings, my pain with me till my grave, all this stuff is really really sensitive to me, hope u respect that, ppl say they move on.. its bs.. ppl cant, atleast the ones who truly loved they moved on with their thoughts, they moved on learning to uk control and live with the reality, they moved on learning to live with the feelings, I believe if u truly love someone and u claim u moved on its still there on back of ur head and ur basically lying

On a positive note, with all these I‚Äôve grown as a human being.. used to think that ‚Äúlove‚Äù is fictional but damn it exists but after this episode I understand ppl better, used to get a bit sympathetic at ppl but now I can actually feel the pain, also learnt that one shouldn‚Äôt love someone/something so much cuz when one can‚Äôt get the person/thing and needs to let go, it hurts a lot. And yes I stopped flirting imo now flirting=playing with someones feelings and its not right, I don‚Äôt wanna have any more attachments in my life apart from myself, cuz i don‚Äôt wanna feel sad anymore.. these feelings are what left me fucked up and I don‚Äôt wanna have those anymore, also I love my dad even more now, when he knew all these stuff I thought he would kick me out or something but he sat with me and actually supported me, srsly if I was in his place I would beat the hell out of my child if I knew all this,I was touched by how my family supported me.. knowing that something bad has happened to me, and yea I‚Äôve decided one think.. I have one job and meaning to my life and that‚Äôs to be a good son to my dad, and to be a good brother to my bro.

And u asked, can u imagine someone else ryt.. nope I cant but uk I love myself now and I‚Äôm pretty sure I need no one else other than myself to be happy

I don‚Äôt demand anything from anyone, infact I am grateful to everyone who supported me.. u,vaibhav,santhan, arsh, u ppl always tried ur best to help me out through this patch

No matter what happens, no matter where I am one thing is clear.. I will keep having feelings for her no matter what, I just want her to be happy and secure wherever and whomever shes with 

I haven‚Äôt conveyed everything I wanted to.. but I think that‚Äôs mostly it.. u get the basic gist of it ryt.. hopefully u understand this..

Once she was like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want all these to come again between us‚Äù and I promised, hope u respect that and conceal all this stuff‚Ä¶
